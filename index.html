            Guatemala City, the capital of Guatemala, is the largest city in Central America and a major cultural, political, and economic hub.
            Founded in 1776 after the destruction of Antigua Guatemala by an earthquake, it blends colonial history with modern development.
            The city is known for its historical sites, including the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace, as well as its vibrant markets and museums.
            As the country’s center for industry, commerce, and government, Guatemala City plays a crucial role in shaping the nation’s contemporary identity.
